    "## Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "This project analyzes disease incidence and population impacts across various counties in California from 2001 to 2022. It aims to identify trends in disease occurrence, gender disparities, and geographical hotspots. The dataset, sourced from data.gov and supported by the California Department of Public Health, contains records on disease incidence by county, year, gender, and population. This analysis utilizes data visualization tools like Tableau and Microsoft Excel to display trends and provide actionable insights into public health patterns.\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Public health and epidemiology are essential in understanding disease spread and population impact over time. Analyzing disease incidence offers insights into the effectiveness of interventions, resource distribution, and policy development. This project focuses on California, which has faced various health challenges over the last 20 years, from infectious diseases to chronic conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis examines disease incidence and population impacts in California counties from 2001 to 2022. It highlights trends, gender disparities, and geographical disease hotspots. The study also explores seasonal patterns and gender-based differences in disease incidence, with males generally experiencing higher incidence rates for vector-borne diseases.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "To identify trends in disease incidence in California counties, focusing on gender-based disparities and geographical disease hotspots. Disease peak areas such as Inyo and Kern counties are contrasted with regions like San Francisco and Sacramento, which show lower disease rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Source\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is publicly available on [data.gov](https://data.gov) and supported by the California Department of Public Health. It includes 189,921 records on disease incidence by county, year, gender, and population for California between 2001 and 2022.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset underwent cleaning to ensure consistency and accuracy, with missing values handled and confidence intervals added for data reliability, following the California Department of Public Healthâ€™s methodology for estimating confidence intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analytical Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "Data analysis and visualization were conducted using:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tableau:** For creating data visualizations and identifying trends.\n",
    "- **Microsoft Excel:** For data organization and preliminary statistical analysis.\n",
