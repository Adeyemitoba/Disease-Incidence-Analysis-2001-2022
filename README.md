1 Introduction
Public health and epidemiology play a key part in understanding how diseases
can be spread and how they impact populations over time. Analyzing the pat-
terns of disease incidence provides useful insights into the effectiveness of health
interventions, resource distribution, and the creation of policies focused on mit-
igating public health risks. In the last twenty years, California has faced various
public health challenge, ranging from infectious diseases such as Lyme disease
to chronic conditions that affect certain population groups.
This project focuses on analyzing disease incidence and population impacts
across various counties in California from year 2001 to 2022. This analysis seeks
to identify various trends in disease occurrence, gender disparities, and geograph-
ical hotspots for specific diseases.
1.1 Background
Public health and epidemiology are important fields used in understanding and
controlling the spread of diseases across populations. Over the years, disease
incidence trends have changed significantly, influenced by factors such as envi-
ronmental and societal. Historical data on public health provides insights into
these changes. California Department of Public Health reports that a broad his-
tory on the health status of counties in California over a period of 31 years
focuses on key public health challenges.

1.2 Problem Statement
The problem discussed in this analysis involves examining the various disease
incidences and impacts on population in the counties in California from year 2001
to 2022. Exploring trends, disparities, and geographical hotspots for diseases,
such as Lyme disease. Also, showing the seasonal peaks, sexually transmitted
diseases and gender disparities, is important. Gender-based differences have also
been linked to vector-borne diseases, with males experiencing higher incidence
rates than females.
1.3 Objective
The objective of this project was to analyze trends in disease incidence in Cal-
ifornia counties, focusing on gender-based disparities and the impact on the
population. Disease peak spots such as Inyo and Kern counties were identified,
while areas such as San Francisco and Sacramento showed lower rates of diseases.
2 Methodology
2.1 Data Source
The dataset was sourced from data.gov, this dataset includes information on
disease incidence by county, year, gender, and population. The dataset, covers
189,921 records, provided great insights into the spread of diseases trends in
California between year 2001 and 2022. The data used is supported by California
Department of Public Health and is publicly available, The department regularly
publishes disease statistics on communicable disease rates and the current trends
in sexually transmitted infections.

3 Data Preparation
3.1 Data Cleaning
The dataset was cleaned to ensure consistency and accuracy. Missing values were
noted and filled in, the confidence intervals were added to assess data reliability.
Also, the California Department of Public Health methods for estimating con-
fidence intervals were followed to accurately represent the rate of diseases over
the period covered.

3.2 Analytical Tools
Tableau and Microsoft Excel was used to statistically organize the dataset. These
tools were used to distinguish trends in various disease incidence and to visualize
the data. This helped in showing disparities and important patterns.

setup with fields from an Excel file on infectious diseases, organized by year, county,
sex, and other metrics.
4 Data Analysis
4.1 Overview of Disease Incidence
The analysis showed the trends in disease incidence from year 2001 to 2022,
with certain diseases showing increase in some counties and decrease in others.
A significant rise in Anaplasmosis cases was for example observed in counties
like Alameda, while Lyme disease revealed seasonal variation across the state.
4.2 Trend Analysis
The analysis of disease incidence trends showed major periods of increased and
decreased activities. The years 2019 and 2020 saw significant changes in disease
rates, this could be related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

4.3 Population Impact
The relationship between population size and disease incidence was studied.
While populated counties like Inyo generally reported higher numbers of cases,
less populated counties like Los Angeles higher per capita incidence rates, sug-
gesting that there are other contributing factors outside population size alone.
Fig. 3. The map reveals a disparity in disease incidence across California counties, with
Inyo County showing exceptionally high cases (97,913), indicating a critical health
concern, while other counties report moderate to minimal impact, underscoring the
need for targeted intervention and sustained prevention efforts.
5 Discussion
5.1 Key Findings
1. Disease Incidence Trends: Certain diseases like Lyme disease showed clear
seasonal increases, while others displayed more random increases. Gender
disparities were observed, with males showing higher rates for vector-borne
diseases and females showing higher rates for certain infections like Chlamy-
dia.
2. Geographical Hotspots: some counties such as Inyo and Kern were stood
out as disease hotspots, while counties like San Francisco and Sacramento
showed lower incidence rates.

5.2 Implications for Public Health
These findings have significant implications for disease control and public health
Interventions in general. Identifying gender disparities and geographical hotspots
provides suggestions in areas where resources and health strategies could be
directed and most effective.
5.3 Limitations
This analysis was limited to only the diseases included in the dataset and only the
counties in California. Other factors, such as policy changes, funds or healthcare
access, were not considered in the analysis. Also, models for prediction were not
explored, as the focus was on descriptive statistics.
6 Conclusion
6.1 Summary of Findings
The analysis showed major trends in disease incidence, identifying the various
counties and the diseases of concern. Gender-based disparities were found in the
frequency of several diseases, and population density played a major role in the
spread of certain diseases.
6.2 Recommendations
It is recommended that public health officials focus on the hotspots that are
identified and consider gender-based interventions. Further research could also
use machine learning models to predict future disease outbreaks.
