## Introduction

Public health and epidemiology are crucial for understanding disease spread and its impact on populations. This project analyzes disease incidence and population impacts in California from 2001 to 2022, focusing on trends, gender disparities, and geographical hotspots.

## Problem Statement

This analysis explores disease incidence trends, disparities, and geographical hotspots across California counties from 2001 to 2022. The study considers seasonal peaks, sexually transmitted diseases, and gender disparities, noting higher vector-borne disease rates in males.

## Objective

The project aims to analyze trends in disease incidence, focusing on gender disparities and population impact. High-incidence areas like Inyo and Kern counties are contrasted with lower-incidence regions like San Francisco and Sacramento.

## Methodology

### Data Source

The dataset, sourced from [data.gov](https://data.gov), includes 189,921 records on disease incidence by county, year, gender, and population in California between 2001 and 2022.

### Data Preparation

The dataset was cleaned for consistency, with missing values handled and confidence intervals added using the California Department of Public Health's methodology.

### Analytical Tools

- **Tableau:** For data visualization and trend analysis.
- **Microsoft Excel:** For statistical organization and preliminary analysis.

## Data Analysis

### Overview of Disease Incidence

The analysis identified trends from 2001 to 2022, highlighting increases in diseases like Anaplasmosis in Alameda and seasonal Lyme disease variations.

### Trend Analysis

Significant disease rate changes occurred in 2019 and 2020, possibly due to the COVID-19 pandemic's impact.

### Population Impact

While populous counties like Los Angeles had higher case numbers, less populated counties like Inyo had higher per capita rates, suggesting other contributing factors.

---

## Discussion

### Key Findings

1. **Disease Trends:** Seasonal peaks for Lyme disease and other disease increases were observed. Gender disparities showed higher rates for vector-borne diseases in males and certain infections in females.
2. **Geographical Hotspots:** Inyo and Kern counties were significant hotspots, while San Francisco and Sacramento showed lower incidence rates.

### Implications for Public Health

The findings suggest targeted resource allocation and gender-specific health strategies could enhance public health interventions.

### Limitations

The analysis is limited to the dataset's diseases and counties in California. External factors like policy changes or healthcare access weren't considered, and no predictive models were used.

---

## Conclusion

### Summary of Findings

The project highlights disease incidence trends, identifying hotspots and gender-based disparities. Population density influenced disease spread, but smaller counties often had higher per capita rates.

### Recommendations

Public health officials should focus on identified hotspots and consider gender-based interventions. Future research could incorporate machine learning for predictive analysis.
