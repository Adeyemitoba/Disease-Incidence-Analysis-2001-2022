## Abstract

This project analyzes disease incidence and population impacts across California counties from 2001 to 2022. Using data from the California Department of Public Health, the analysis identifies disease trends, gender disparities, and geographical hotspots. The analysis utilizes Tableau and Microsoft Excel for data visualization, providing insights for targeted health interventions.

## Introduction

Public health and epidemiology are vital for understanding disease spread and population impact over time. Analyzing disease incidence provides insights into the effectiveness of interventions, resource distribution, and policy development. This project focuses on California, which has faced health challenges ranging from Lyme disease to other chronic conditions.

## Problem Statement

This analysis examines disease incidence and population impacts in California counties from 2001 to 2022. It highlights trends, disparities, and disease hotspots, and considers seasonal patterns and gender-based differences.

## Objective

To identify trends in disease incidence across California counties, with a focus on gender-based disparities and geographic hotspots. High-incidence areas like Inyo and Kern counties are contrasted with lower-incidence regions like San Francisco and Sacramento.

## Methodology

### Data Source

The dataset is available on [data.gov](https://data.gov) and provided by the California Department of Public Health. It includes 189,921 records on disease incidence by county, year, gender, and population across California from 2001 to 2022.

### Data Preparation

The dataset was cleaned for consistency and accuracy. Missing values were handled, and confidence intervals were added using the California Department of Public Health’s methods for estimating rates over time.

### Analytical Tools

- **Tableau:** For data visualization and trend analysis.
- **Microsoft Excel:** For data organization and preliminary statistical analysis.

## Data Analysis

### Overview of Disease Incidence

The analysis showed trends in disease incidence from 2001 to 2022, with certain diseases increasing in some counties and decreasing in others. For example, Anaplasmosis cases increased in Alameda, while Lyme disease showed seasonal variation statewide.

### Trend Analysis

The analysis highlighted major periods of change, especially during 2019-2020, which could relate to the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Population Impact

The analysis explored population size and disease incidence relationships. While populous counties like Los Angeles had high case numbers, less populated counties like Inyo had high per capita rates, suggesting other contributing factors.

---

## Discussion

### Key Findings

1. **Disease Incidence Trends:** Diseases like Lyme disease showed seasonal peaks, while other diseases increased more randomly. Gender disparities were noted, with males having higher rates for vector-borne diseases and females for infections like Chlamydia.
2. **Geographical Hotspots:** Inyo and Kern counties were identified as hotspots, while San Francisco and Sacramento reported lower incidence rates.

### Implications for Public Health

These findings suggest areas where resources and targeted health strategies could be most effective, given the identification of gender disparities and hotspots.

### Limitations

The analysis was limited to the dataset’s diseases and California counties only. External factors such as policy changes or healthcare access were not considered, and no predictive models were used, as this analysis focused on descriptive statistics.

---

## Conclusion

### Summary of Findings

The project highlights disease incidence trends, identifying significant hotspots and gender-based disparities. Population density influenced disease spread, though some smaller counties had high per capita rates.

### Recommendations

Public health officials should focus on identified hotspots and consider gender-based interventions. Further research could use machine learning models to predict future outbreaks.
