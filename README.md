## Abstract

This project analyzes disease incidence and population impacts across California counties from 2001 to 2022. Using data sourced from the California Department of Public Health, the study identifies trends in disease incidence, gender disparities, and geographical hotspots. Analytical tools like Tableau and Microsoft Excel were used to visualize key patterns, highlighting the need for targeted public health interventions.

## Introduction

Public health and epidemiology are essential for understanding the spread and impact of diseases. This project focuses on analyzing disease incidence trends in California from 2001 to 2022. It highlights geographical disparities, gender differences, and seasonal peaks in disease cases, providing actionable insights for public health planning.

---

## Problem Statement

The project examines disease incidence trends, exploring the relationship between population size and disease cases, identifying seasonal trends, and analyzing disparities in disease distribution across California counties.

---

## Objective

To analyze disease incidence trends in California counties, focusing on gender-based disparities, population impacts, and geographical hotspots. Counties like Inyo and Kern are studied for high incidence rates, while regions like San Francisco and Sacramento are examined for lower trends.

---

## Methodology

### Data Source

The dataset was sourced from [data.gov](https://data.gov) and includes 189,921 records covering disease incidence by county, year, gender, and population. Key resources:
- **[Data.gov Dataset](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/infectious-diseases-by-disease-county-year-and-sex-6e856)**
- **[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Adeyemitoba/Disease-Incidence-Analysis-2001-2022)**
- **[Overleaf Project](https://www.overleaf.com/project/6716bc6ade42a8c3ebd0e744)**

### Data Preparation

- **Cleaning:** Missing values were handled by replacing with zeroes in key columns like `Cases` and `Confidence Intervals`.  
- **Attributes:**  
  - **Year:** Temporal reference for trends.  
  - **Counties (e.g., Kern, Los Angeles):** Disease incidence by location.  
  - **California:** Total statewide disease cases.  

---

## Data Analysis

### Overview

- Trends from 2001–2022 revealed significant spikes and declines in disease incidence.
- Seasonal variations observed in diseases like Lyme disease.
- A notable rise in Anaplasmosis cases was recorded in Alameda County.

### Trend Analysis

- Major changes during 2019-2020 likely reflect the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Population Impact

- Higher case counts in populous counties like Los Angeles.
- Higher per capita rates in smaller counties like Inyo suggest non-population-related factors.

### Visualizations

- **Trend Line Chart:** Annual disease incidence across California (2001–2022).  
- **Geographic Map:** County-level disparities, with Inyo County showing high incidence.  
- **Stacked Column Chart:** Gender distribution of disease cases.  

---

## Discussion

### Key Findings

1. **Disease Trends:** Seasonal increases in Lyme disease and gender disparities (e.g., higher rates of vector-borne diseases in males).  
2. **Geographical Hotspots:** Counties like Inyo and Kern emerged as disease hotspots.

### Implications

The findings underscore the importance of targeted interventions in high-incidence regions and addressing gender-based health disparities.

### Limitations

The analysis was limited to available datasets and counties within California. External factors like policy changes and healthcare access were not considered. Predictive models were not explored.

---

## Conclusion

### Summary of Findings

The analysis highlights significant trends in disease incidence, identifies hotspots, and uncovers gender disparities. Population density was a major factor, but per capita rates in smaller counties revealed additional influences.

### Recommendations

- Focus interventions in identified hotspots.  
- Implement gender-specific public health strategies.  
- Explore predictive models for future research to anticipate outbreaks.
