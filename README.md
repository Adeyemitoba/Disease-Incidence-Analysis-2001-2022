## Introduction

Public health and epidemiology are vital for understanding and controlling disease spread. This project focuses on disease incidence and population impact across California from 2001 to 2022. Key trends, gender disparities, and geographical hotspots are analyzed to inform health interventions and policies.

## Problem Statement

The analysis examines disease incidence and population impacts in California counties from 2001 to 2022, highlighting trends, disparities, and hotspots. The study also considers seasonal and gender-based differences in disease incidence.

## Objective

To identify trends in disease incidence, focusing on gender-based disparities and geographical hotspots. High-incidence areas like Inyo and Kern are contrasted with lower-incidence areas such as San Francisco and Sacramento.

## Methodology

### Data Source

The dataset is publicly available on [data.gov](https://data.gov) and provided by the California Department of Public Health. It includes 189,921 records on disease incidence by county, year, gender, and population in California from 2001 to 2022.

### Data Preparation

The dataset was cleaned for consistency and accuracy. Missing values were filled, and confidence intervals were added per the California Department of Public Health’s methods for estimating disease rates over time.

### Analytical Tools

- **Tableau:** For interactive data visualizations.
- **Microsoft Excel:** For initial data organization and statistical analysis.

## Data Analysis

### Overview of Disease Incidence

This analysis reveals significant disease incidence trends, including increases in some counties and decreases in others. Notable rises in cases, such as Anaplasmosis in Alameda County and seasonal peaks of Lyme disease, were observed.

### Trend Analysis

Trend analysis identified periods of increased and decreased disease activity, particularly around 2020, which may correlate with the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Population Impact

The analysis explored the relationship between population size and disease incidence. High-population counties like Los Angeles had higher case numbers, but counties like Inyo showed higher per capita rates, suggesting contributing factors beyond population size alone.

---

## Discussion

### Key Findings

1. **Disease Incidence Trends:** Seasonal peaks for diseases like Lyme disease were identified, with gender disparities in incidence.
2. **Geographical Hotspots:** Inyo and Kern counties were identified as disease hotspots, while San Francisco and Sacramento had lower rates.

### Implications for Public Health

These findings suggest that targeted resources and gender-specific interventions could improve public health outcomes. The study’s identification of hotspots and disparities could inform future strategies.

### Limitations

This analysis was limited to the dataset's included diseases and regions. External factors, such as policy changes or healthcare access, were not considered, and no predictive models were used, as this analysis focused on descriptive statistics.

---

## Conclusion

### Summary of Findings

The project highlights trends in disease incidence, identifying significant hotspots and gender-based disparities. Population density influenced disease spread, but some smaller counties exhibited high per capita rates.

### Recommendations

Public health officials should focus on identified hotspots and consider gender-based interventions. Future research could incorporate machine learning models to predict disease outbreaks.
